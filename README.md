# GruntWatcher for an ASP.NET MVC project#

Example of using Grunt and grunt-contrib-water to automatically update a web page when an MVC *.cshtml, *.css, *.js files change.

This allows you to keep multiple browsers open, make a change to a file (and save it), and see the results in multiple browsers without having to press refresh in each browser.
